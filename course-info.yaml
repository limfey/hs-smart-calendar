summary: <p>The pace of life is quite high these days. The number of tasks that a
  person performs every day is huge. Everyone once forgot about an important meeting,
  a phone call, or even to wish a friend or relative a happy birthday. Let's try to
  solve this problem! In this project, we will develop a simple reminder calendar
  that will be able to save notes and dates of birthdays and remind us about them.
  If you want to learn how to work with the date and time format and create a calendar
  assistant, this project is for you!</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/355?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/355</a>
