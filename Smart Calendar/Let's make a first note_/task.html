<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>You learned how to recognize and display the date and time, and it's excellent! However, the calendar will become more interesting if you know how to compare specific dates and events. In this stage, let's try to create notes. You will teach your program to add a note and display it on the screen.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>
<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Display the current date and time;</li>
<li>Get the date and time of the event from a user. Your program should ask the user to input a year, month, day, hour, and minute separately, one by one (look at the example below). Each user input will contain one number as an answer;</li>
<li>Ask the user to enter the text of the note;</li>
<li>Display how much time is left before the action described in the note.</li>
</ol>
<p>Output the message on every step! You can see all messages in the example below.</p>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Current date and time:
2020-05-13 20:33:03.907875
